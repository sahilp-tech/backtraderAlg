# backtraderAlg

I created a backtrading algorithm using python where I employed the strategy to buy on a dip and sell shortly after. 

* For this code I used NVDA stock as an example and backtracked this strategy to see what my result would be after one year. We can adjust the time frame to backtract different datasets 
* We can have a certain amount of money that we intially have in our portfolio and see how much we would make employing this strategy

Below are examples of the graphs that are produced using this algorithm
